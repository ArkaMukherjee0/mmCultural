## üéØ Abstract

As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for responsible AI systems. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through multimodal story generation, developing a novel framework that evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs across 42 countries.
Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation capabilities with rich culturally-specific vocabulary, but also concerning limitations: dramatic performance variance across architectures, inverse cultural alignment in some models, and architectural bias in automated metrics contradicting human assessments.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
Our mmCultural dataset contains:

- 1,470 unique prompts spanning diverse cultural concepts
- 42 countries across 5 continents
- 35 cultural concepts (honesty, empathy, cooperation, etc.)
- Culturally-relevant images for each prompt
- 73,500 generated stories from 5 VLMs
- Human evaluation scores across 10 cultural competence dimensions
